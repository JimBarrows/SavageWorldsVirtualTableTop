Feature: CI/CD Pipeline Health and Test Suite Reliability
  As a development team
  I want all unit tests to pass consistently in the CI/CD pipeline
  So that new features can be developed and deployed without interference from technical debt

  Background:
    Given the application has a comprehensive test suite
    And the CI/CD pipeline runs automated quality checks
    And developers need reliable feedback on code changes

  Scenario: Unit test suite executes successfully without blocking issues
    Given the development team has written unit tests for components
    When the CI/CD pipeline runs the complete test suite
    Then all unit tests should pass
    And no import path errors should occur
    And no mock function configuration issues should prevent execution
    And no constructor invocation errors should block test runs

  Scenario: Test assertions accurately reflect component behavior
    Given components have specific expected behaviors
    When unit tests validate component functionality
    Then test assertions should match actual component output
    And array length expectations should align with component logic
    And component state should be validated correctly

  Scenario: Async test operations complete within reasonable timeframes
    Given components perform asynchronous operations
    When tests validate async behavior
    Then async operations should complete within expected timeout periods
    And proper test waiting strategies should be implemented
    And authentication context changes should be handled appropriately

  Scenario: Development workflow remains unblocked by test infrastructure
    Given developers are implementing new features
    When they run the test suite locally or in CI/CD
    Then the test suite should complete in under 30 seconds
    And all quality gates should pass
    And new pull requests should not be blocked by pre-existing test failures

  Scenario: Test suite provides reliable development feedback
    Given the test suite validates business logic and component behavior
    When developers make changes to the codebase
    Then test results should accurately reflect the impact of changes
    And false positive failures should not block development workflow
    And test execution should be consistent across different environments
