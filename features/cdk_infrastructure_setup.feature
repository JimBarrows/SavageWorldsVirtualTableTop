Feature: AWS CDK Infrastructure Project Setup
  As a DevOps engineer
  I want to establish a CDK project structure
  So that I can deploy SWVTT infrastructure consistently across environments

  Background:
    Given I have AWS CLI configured with valid credentials
    And I have Node.js 18+ installed
    And I have AWS CDK CLI installed

  @infrastructure @setup
  Scenario: Initialize CDK project with TypeScript
    Given I am in the project root directory
    When I initialize a new CDK project with TypeScript
    Then the project should have a valid CDK TypeScript structure
    And the CDK configuration file should be created
    And TypeScript configuration should be properly set up

  @infrastructure @dependencies
  Scenario: Install required CDK dependencies
    Given I have a CDK project initialized
    When I install all required AWS CDK libraries
    Then all CDK dependencies should be available
    And the package.json should include all required CDK libraries
    And no dependency conflicts should exist

  @infrastructure @structure
  Scenario: Create project directory structure following AWS best practices
    Given I have a CDK project with dependencies installed
    When I create the standardized directory structure
    Then the lib/stacks directory should contain all required stack files
    And the lib/constructs directory should exist for custom constructs
    And the config directory should have environment-specific files
    And the test directory should be set up for infrastructure testing

  @infrastructure @stacks
  Scenario: Create base infrastructure stack classes
    Given I have the proper directory structure
    When I create the foundational stack classes
    Then the network stack should be defined for VPC and networking
    And the database stack should be defined for RDS configuration
    And the backend stack should be defined for application services
    And the frontend stack should be defined for UI deployment
    And the monitoring stack should be defined for observability
    And all stacks should follow CDK best practices

  @infrastructure @configuration
  Scenario: Set up environment configuration system
    Given I have base stack classes created
    When I configure environment-specific settings
    Then each environment (dev, qa, prod) should have its own config file
    And configuration should include appropriate resource sizing
    And sensitive values should be handled through Parameter Store
    And configuration validation should prevent invalid deployments

  @infrastructure @testing
  Scenario: Configure infrastructure testing framework
    Given I have stacks and configuration set up
    When I set up the testing framework
    Then Jest should be configured for infrastructure tests
    And snapshot tests should be available for stack validation
    And unit tests should be possible for custom constructs
    And test coverage reporting should be configured

  @infrastructure @validation
  Scenario: Validate complete CDK project setup
    Given I have completed all setup tasks
    When I run CDK synthesis command
    Then CloudFormation templates should be generated successfully
    And no CDK errors or warnings should be present
    And the project should be ready for environment deployment
    And all configuration files should be valid
