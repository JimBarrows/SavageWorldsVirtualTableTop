Feature: ESLint Code Quality Compliance
  As a software development team
  I want all code to pass ESLint validation without warnings
  So that we maintain consistent code quality and follow React best practices

  Background:
    Given a React application codebase with ESLint configuration
    And the development team values code quality and consistency

  Scenario: Development team runs linting validation
    Given the development team has completed code changes
    When they run the ESLint validation command
    Then there should be 0 ESLint warnings reported
    And there should be 0 ESLint errors reported
    And the linting process should exit with success status

  Scenario: PropTypes validation ensures component reliability
    Given React components that accept props from parent components
    When the ESLint PropTypes validation rule is applied
    Then all component props should have proper PropTypes definitions
    And missing PropTypes should be flagged as warnings
    And the component interface should be clearly documented through PropTypes

  Scenario: Unused variable detection improves code cleanliness
    Given JavaScript/React source code files
    When the ESLint unused variable detection runs
    Then all declared variables should be used within their scope
    And unused imports should be identified for removal
    And dead code should be eliminated to improve maintainability

  Scenario: React best practices enforcement
    Given React component implementations
    When ESLint React-specific rules are applied
    Then components should follow React coding standards
    And potential runtime issues should be detected early
    And unreachable code should be identified and removed

  Scenario: Pre-commit quality gate validation
    Given a developer attempts to commit code changes
    When the pre-commit hooks execute ESLint validation
    Then the commit should only succeed if ESLint passes without warnings
    And developers should receive immediate feedback on code quality issues
    And no low-quality code should enter the repository

  Scenario: Continuous integration quality assurance
    Given code changes submitted through pull requests
    When the CI/CD pipeline runs automated quality checks
    Then ESLint validation should be part of the quality gate
    And pull requests with ESLint warnings should not be mergeable
    And the team should maintain consistent code quality standards

  Scenario Outline: Component-specific PropTypes compliance
    Given a React component named "<component_name>"
    When the component receives props "<prop_names>"
    Then each prop should have corresponding PropTypes validation
    And the PropTypes should accurately reflect the expected data types
    And the component should be self-documenting through its PropTypes

    Examples:
      | component_name | prop_names |
      | ArcaneBackgroundEditor | onChange, item, index, onDelete, id |
      | GearEditor | onChange, item, index, onDelete |
      | EffectsEditor | onChange, item, index, onDelete, id |
      | VehicleEditor | item |

  Scenario: Systematic warning resolution process
    Given 110 ESLint warnings in the codebase
    When the development team systematically addresses each warning category
    Then PropTypes warnings should be resolved by adding proper validation
    And unused variable warnings should be resolved by removing dead code
    And React best practice warnings should be resolved through refactoring
    And the final result should be 0 warnings across the entire codebase
