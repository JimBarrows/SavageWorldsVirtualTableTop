Feature: Security Vulnerability Remediation
  As a development team
  I want to identify and resolve npm security vulnerabilities
  So that the application is secure and users' data is protected

  Background:
    Given the project has npm dependencies
    And security vulnerabilities have been identified in the dependency tree

  @security @critical
  Scenario: Critical vulnerabilities are completely resolved
    Given the application has critical security vulnerabilities
    When I run a comprehensive security audit
    Then all critical vulnerabilities should be resolved
    And no new critical vulnerabilities should be introduced
    And the security audit should report zero critical issues

  @security @high
  Scenario: High severity vulnerabilities are completely resolved
    Given the application has high severity security vulnerabilities
    When I run a comprehensive security audit
    Then all high severity vulnerabilities should be resolved
    And no new high severity vulnerabilities should be introduced
    And the security audit should report zero high severity issues

  @security @moderate
  Scenario: Moderate vulnerabilities are addressed appropriately
    Given the application has moderate security vulnerabilities
    When I run a comprehensive security audit
    Then moderate vulnerabilities are either resolved or documented with business justification
    And any remaining moderate vulnerabilities have risk assessment documentation
    And the number of moderate vulnerabilities is significantly reduced from baseline

  @security @low
  Scenario: Low priority vulnerabilities are managed
    Given the application has low priority security vulnerabilities
    When I run a comprehensive security audit
    Then low priority vulnerabilities are either resolved or documented with business justification
    And any remaining low vulnerabilities have risk assessment documentation

  @security @regression
  Scenario: Application functionality remains intact after security updates
    Given security vulnerabilities have been resolved through dependency updates
    When the application is started in development mode
    Then the application should start successfully without errors
    And all existing functionality should work as expected
    And no new runtime errors should be introduced

  @security @build
  Scenario: Build process succeeds after security remediation
    Given security dependencies have been updated
    When I build the application for production
    Then the build should complete successfully
    And no build errors should occur due to dependency updates
    And the production bundle should be generated correctly

  @security @testing
  Scenario: Test suite passes after dependency updates
    Given security vulnerabilities have been resolved
    When I run the complete test suite
    Then all existing unit tests should pass
    And all existing BDD tests should pass
    And no test failures should be introduced by security updates

  @security @cicd
  Scenario: CI/CD pipeline security checks pass
    Given security vulnerabilities have been remediated
    When the CI/CD pipeline runs security audits
    Then the security audit step should pass
    And no pipeline failures should occur due to security issues
    And the security scan results should meet compliance requirements

  @security @documentation
  Scenario: Security remediation is properly documented
    Given security vulnerabilities have been addressed
    When reviewing the remediation documentation
    Then all resolved vulnerabilities should be documented
    And any remaining vulnerabilities should have risk justifications
    And the remediation approach should be clearly explained
    And future maintenance recommendations should be provided
