Feature: Test Coverage Improvement
  As a development team member
  I want to improve test coverage to 85% minimum
  So that we meet quality standards and prevent regressions

  Background:
    Given the project currently has 45% test coverage
    And the CI/CD pipeline requires 85% minimum coverage
    And pre-commit hooks are configured to enforce coverage standards

  Scenario: Component Test Coverage Achievement
    Given I have identified untested components in the codebase
    When I write comprehensive unit tests for each component
    Then the component should have at least 85% code coverage
    And the tests should cover happy path scenarios
    And the tests should cover edge cases
    And the tests should cover error conditions

  Scenario: Page Component Testing
    Given I have page components without test coverage
    When I create unit tests for PlotPointAdd page
    And I create unit tests for PlotPointEdit page
    And I create unit tests for PlotPointList page
    Then each page component should be thoroughly tested
    And routing behavior should be validated
    And user interactions should be tested

  Scenario: Authentication Component Testing
    Given authentication is a critical security feature
    When I write tests for login functionality
    And I write tests for signup functionality
    And I write tests for password reset functionality
    Then authentication flows should be fully covered
    And error handling should be tested
    And token management should be validated

  Scenario: Form Component Testing
    Given forms are complex interactive components
    When I test form validation
    And I test form submission
    And I test field interactions
    Then form behavior should be predictable
    And validation errors should be properly displayed
    And successful submissions should be handled correctly

  Scenario: Data Model Testing
    Given data models contain business logic
    When I test model methods
    And I test model validation
    And I test model transformations
    Then models should behave consistently
    And business rules should be enforced
    And data integrity should be maintained

  Scenario: Coverage Report Validation
    Given I have written comprehensive tests
    When I run the test coverage report
    Then statements coverage should be at least 85%
    And branches coverage should be at least 85%
    And functions coverage should be at least 85%
    And lines coverage should be at least 85%

  Scenario: Pre-commit Hook Enforcement
    Given pre-commit hooks are configured
    When I attempt to commit code
    Then coverage checks should execute automatically
    And commits should be blocked if coverage is below 85%
    And detailed coverage reports should be provided

  Scenario: CI/CD Pipeline Success
    Given test coverage meets the 85% threshold
    When the CI/CD pipeline executes
    Then all quality gates should pass
    And the build should complete successfully
    And deployment should be allowed to proceed
