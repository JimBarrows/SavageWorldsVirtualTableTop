# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current State
As of 2025-08-13, the project has the following test coverage:
- **Statements**: 45.37%
- **Branches**: 49.79%
- **Functions**: 33.47%
- **Lines**: 45.37%

The CI/CD pipeline requires **85% minimum coverage** across all metrics.

## Coverage Gap Analysis
- **Gap to 85%**: ~40% improvement needed across all metrics
- **Root Cause**: Historical technical debt with minimal test coverage in legacy code
- **New Code Coverage**: Security utilities added in PR #198 have 100% coverage (34 tests)

## Immediate Actions (PR #198)
1. **Security Framework Implementation**: ✅ Complete with comprehensive testing
2. **BDD Scenarios**: ✅ 9 scenarios for security vulnerability management
3. **Unit Tests**: ✅ 34 tests for SecurityAuditManager and VulnerabilityClassifier
4. **Pre-commit Hooks**: ✅ Added coverage checks to prevent future regression

## Short-term Improvements (Next Sprint)
1. **Critical Path Coverage**: Focus on high-risk components
   - Authentication components (Login, Signup)
   - Data management (PlotPoint CRUD operations)
   - State management (Redux actions/reducers)

2. **Incremental Coverage Goals**:
   - Week 1: Raise to 55% (10% improvement)
   - Week 2: Raise to 65% (10% improvement)
   - Week 3: Raise to 75% (10% improvement)
   - Week 4: Achieve 85% target

3. **Test Categories to Add**:
   - Component rendering tests
   - User interaction tests
   - API integration tests
   - Error handling tests

## Long-term Strategy
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Enforce TDD for all new features
2. **Coverage Requirements**: No PR merges below 85% for new code
3. **Refactoring Initiative**: Gradually refactor and test legacy code
4. **Automated Coverage Reports**: Weekly coverage trend reports

## Technical Debt Items
### High Priority Components Needing Tests
- `src/App.js` - Main application component
- `src/pages/*` - All page components
- `src/components/plotpoint/*` - Complex form components
- `src/models/*` - Data models and business logic

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
- Fix FontAwesome dependency issues preventing test execution
- Upgrade testing libraries to latest versions
- Implement snapshot testing for UI components
- Add integration test suite for GraphQL operations

## Metrics and Monitoring
- **Current Baseline**: 45.37% average coverage
- **Target**: 85% minimum across all metrics
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks for full compliance
- **Review Cycle**: Weekly coverage review meetings

## Risk Mitigation
While coverage is improved:
1. **Manual Testing**: Enhanced manual testing protocols
2. **Code Reviews**: Stricter review requirements
3. **Staging Environment**: Extended testing in staging
4. **Rollback Plan**: Quick rollback procedures for production issues

## Exemption Request for PR #198
Given that:
- PR #198 adds comprehensive security vulnerability management
- New code has 100% test coverage
- Pre-commit hooks prevent future regression
- Coverage improvement plan is documented

We request temporary exemption from the 85% threshold for this PR while the broader coverage improvement initiative is executed.
